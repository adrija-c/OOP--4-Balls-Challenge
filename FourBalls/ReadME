Approach:

- Created a class called "Ball.java" 
- Used constructors with 3 parameters
    - position
    - distance
    - speed
- Used getters and setters to provide access to the private instance variables and return/modify values assigned to the variables.

- Created another file with class FourBalls which extends PApplet class
- Created public constants HEIGHT, WIDTH of the app and DIAMETER of the balls , then an instance of FourBalls (fb) that runs the sketch using PApplet.runSketch.
- Four Ball objects (b1, b2, b3, b4) with different initial positions, distances, and speeds.
- drawBall method draws a ball at a specified position and distance from the top-left corner of the window using ellipse().
-draw() method to repeatedly call and update visual display of balls.
